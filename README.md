# ManageAUV
An application to manage Autonomous Underwater Vehicle.<br />
In the **node_modules** folder there is a zip file containing the frameworks required in the application, in the **lealfet** folder there is a zip file containing the javascript libraries to realize a mission for the device, finally, in the **views** folder there are the html files containing html,css and javascript code.<br />
Thanks to Andrea Vitaletti for giving me the opportunity to realize it.
